          <h2>Colorado Springs</h2>
          <p>I grew up in Colorado Springs near Garden of the Gods and Pikes Peak. The Springs was not a bad place to grow up, and I have about a million family members there, so I make the drive down fairly often.</p>

          <h2>Aaron</h2>
          <p>I met my husband at Mizzou in 2007, and after about four years of living in different places, somehow found him in Fort Collins. He’s a web developer, and amazingly, magnanimously, does not charge me for tutoring.</p>

          <h2>Jen &amp; Gracie</h2>
          <p>My sister just had a baby, Gracie, who is the first little one in our family. Everybody in the fam is obsessed with her, including me. During our class breaks, I’ll probably be with them on their mountain ranch.</p>

          <h2>Being Outside</h2>
          <p>I love getting into the hills. Backpacking, fastpacking, running, and snowshoeing are my favorite things to do, and I imagine that with this new life of sitting at a computer for hours on end, getting out into the mountains is going to be necessary therapy.</p>

          <h2>Pong, Vball &amp; Tennis</h2>
          <p>I have an inexplicable attraction to sports in which one should hit the shit out of a ball. I grew up playing volleyball and ping pong, and I’m trying so hard to be good at tennis. I would love to get together to play any of these sports with you guys. </p>

          <h2>Learning</h2>
          <p>I think part of what attracted me to teaching was that as a teacher, you are constantly forced to learn. This is also what excites me about web development. I can’t wait to learn from the Galvanize instructors and my cohort peers.</p>

      <p>Let's hang out. I'm almost always down for a ping pong game, a tennis match, a run, or a beer after class.</p>
